VFX To Do:

Slime Boss

Disrupting Slam - Maybe use an Iron Wave effect?

Equalize - Could warrant something custom maybe.  Scales that appear overhead, then drop, then fade away?

Liquidate - Use Inflame effects but going down and colored purple

Nibble - should use a Bite hit, maybe smaller or faster than normal - maybe a few of them in sequence

One-Two Combo - Could use a couple of the small hits from Carnage

Prepare/Prepare Crush - maybe use the flash and image from the summon sword effect of Marked, image is just a big set of question marks

Roll Through - maybe a custom 'spinning big slime ball rolling through the enemies' effect

Rally the Troops - green colored 'shout' wave effect

The Guardian

Strike - maybe Strike could swap to the claw effect used in Rip and Tear?

Incinerate - Flamethrower

Roll Attack - far cry from realistic, but it could be funny to have Guardian actually roll if the Defensive Mode triggers

Temporal cards - Bluish version of regular attack/defend animations (I have code for this already, add it later)

Prismatic Barrier - recolor the block effects based on Gems in the card!? IE, Ruby Sapphire Quartz would have regular beam, red beam, blue beam, white beam

Refracted Beam - Rainbow beam. Art is so good on these.

Time Bomb - might be cool to have it do the Astrologer's Cataclysm wave in reverse time, then the explosion

Hexaghost

Seals - display the number onscreen like a stamp or something? I'm imagining an I, II, etc popping up somewhere for sure.

Force-Ignite - orange/yellow sparks coming off of the Force-Ignited Ghostflame. will need some refactoring if we do this, as Force Ignite is currently not actually an action

Poltergeist - some kind of ghostly projectile / helper / something, inspired by Summon Orb

Charged Barrage - a barrage of fire, actually lobbed at the enemy

Doomsday - when the power triggers during Ignition, light up the screen edges orange

Rain of Embers - embers fall from the sky

Sixth Seal - card reward has spooky particles coming off it in the rewards screen?

Heat Metal - enemy bursts into green flames when the Soulburn reapplication happens

Ghost Lash - send a swirling ghostly thing at an enemy? Moving like the ghosts in Haunting Echo's art

Ghostflame Wall - green version of flame barrier, if I haven't already done that

Incorporeal - Fade in and out of existence, temporary like Puddle Form

Radiant Flame - this could be another spot for a helper-esque thing.

Unleash Spirits - Same swirling ghost into the enemy effect as Ghost Lash, but for every card?

Searing Wound - Some kind of pain effect

Automaton

Bug Barrage - launch glitches at an enemy?

Cultist Strike - maybe cacaw on Compile.

Break - something brutal

Mutator - Steal jobby's transform vfx for this.

Oil Spill - poison launch effect?

Sticky Shield - green version of the regular block vfx (should have code for this)

Dark Dash - some kind of dark attack.

Merge Conflict - blue beam, like the art

Hardcode - some kind of golden reskin or something in the Function UI while you have the power to make it clear the next Func is going to deck?

Virus - same as Mutator

Early Access - Red beam
